### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1643514655/6611/wave-animated.gif" width="25" />

My name is [**Arnold**](https://arn0ld.me), a software engineer from Budapest, Hungary.

I specialize mostly on **backend development**, but I also enjoy creating visually appealing web pages using industry-leading frameworks.

Outside of work, I am interested in following the advancements in computer science, especially in artificial intelligence.
